# Functional-Programming-in-Scala

Implementation of exercises from Functional Programming in Scala book.

I'm publishing it mostly because I wrote quite many tests, which you can as an inspiration to write your own tests, or
just copy to test your implementation. Unfortunately, the official repository does not contain any unit tests. At the
moment of writing this readme the repository has 11 chapters finished and includes **474 unit tests**. Those unit tests
also leverage the power of **ScalaCheck** Of course each chapter contains my own code, not just copy-paste from the
book, so feel free to get inspiration from it too.
